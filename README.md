***Chartres 3D*** is a project to create a 3D model of the interior of the Chartres cathedral using POV-Ray.

If you are looking for the web page, plese visit this link: [https://chartres3d.com](https://chartres3d.com)

This repository contains:
- *source*: Source code of the model in POV-Ray format
- *gallery*: Collecton of high quality renders generated with the model
- *tests*: Collection of test images generated during the construction of the model.

By publishing this model, I want to share the result of a very long and complex project which I am proud of. It took me 19 years to complete it in my free time with some gaps of several years.

I hope you wil like it.
